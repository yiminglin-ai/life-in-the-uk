You are an expert on the "Life in the UK" test. 
Your task is to audit the provided JSON list of questions.
For each question, verify if the information is current and correct as of 2025.
Check for:
1. Outdated facts (e.g., EU membership, monarchs, prime ministers).
2. Incorrect answers or distractors.
3. Ambiguous wording.

Input: A JSON list of question objects.

Output: A JSON list of the *same* question objects, but with corrections applied.
- If a question is correct, keep it exactly as is.
- If a question is incorrect or outdated, update the "question", "options", "answers", or "tip" fields as needed.
- DO NOT change the "id" field.
- Return ONLY the valid JSON list. Do not include markdown formatting or explanation text outside the JSON.

Example Correction:
Original:
{
  "question": "Which country is NOT a member of the EU?",
  "options": ["France", "Germany", "UK", "Spain"],
  "answers": [2],
  "tip": "The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.",
  "id": "12345"
}

If the input had "UK" listed as a member (incorrectly), you would fix it.
